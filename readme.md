# humane.js
This project was heavily inspired by [humanmsg](http://code.google.com/p/humanmsg/) project for jQuery.  I really
liked the project but I wanted to remove the jQuery dependency, add support for CSS transitions, and have more 
control over the timing.

## About
humane.js tries to be as unobtrusive as possible to the user experience while providing helpful information that is
clear and grabs the users attention.  It is framework independent.  Customizable.

## Setup
Setup is simple:

  - Download tar/zip
  - Select a [theme](https://github.com/wavded/humane-js/wiki/Themes) from `themes` dir.
  - Include the theme CSS in your page
  - Include `humane.min.js` in your page

## Demo/Usage

You can see a [demo and usage here](http://wavded.github.com/humane-js/)

## Custom Themes

Got a neat theme/animation, love to see it.  View `theme-src/bigbox.styl` for an template to get started (uses [Stylus](http://learnboost.github.com/stylus/) w/ Nib and Canvas).

To get setup with Stylus use [npm](http://npmjs.org):

```sh
(sudo) npm install -g stylus nib canvas
```

With Stylus installed you can watch for changes and compile into CSS by running:

```sh
make watch
```
